Hello, this is my project to consolidate knowledge after studying at java courses.
<br>
I needed a project for which i can use spring boot, spring mvc, spring data jpa, spring security and hibernate knowledge.
<br>
So i created a web app, where you can register & select a city and get weather for him.
<br>
<br>
<b>What you should know:</b>
<br>
•	Web app based on Accuweather API, so if you have a free api token, you only have 50 calls/day
<br>
•	You need to configure the api token in [ParseURL class](src/main/java/com/zagr/konst/weatherApp/controller/parse/ParseURL.java)
